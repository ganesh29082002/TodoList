# TodoList
The MERN stack-based todo list app allows users to keep track of their tasks and helps them stay organized. The app has a user-friendly interface that displays all the tasks in three different categories: active, done, and all. Users can easily add new tasks, mark tasks as done, and delete tasks they no longer need.
